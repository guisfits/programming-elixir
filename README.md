# About

Notes and exercises from the book **Programming Elixir ≥ 1.6** by **Dave Thomas**.

# Update

I stopped to read this book and start read **Elixir in Action**. The main reason that I learning Elixir is for fault tolerance and high distributed systems, and **Elixir in Action** sees to cover a lot more about this deeply. Also, I heard José Valim recommends this book as _default_ resource to learn Elixir.
